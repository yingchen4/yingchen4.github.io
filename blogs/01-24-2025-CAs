        <p>New Working Experience</p>
        <p>I will be working as a CA in spring for CS 222 and Math 257! </p>
        <p> In cs 222, I will lead a team of 4 and provide support while they are creating their own software project. My responsibilities 
        includes holding weekly meetings, supporting the team it they encounter problems, and providing feedback of their product. I feel excited to see how a new product is been created ÔºÅ</p>
        <p>In Math 257, I will hold 2 discussion sessions at 9 AM covering Linear Algebra. During each discussion session, students will be doing a Python lab practicing the theories they learned from lectures. I help students getting over the problems and explain what is going on with the code.</p>
